ATO’s were created by the NIST in accordance with the FISMA Act of 2002.
SSP’s are the lengthy documents created in order to satisfy all the
requirements of the ATO, and list out the required security features,

## FISMAtic Proof of Concept Objectives

While the full development of FISMAtic is important to the bureau, based
on an assessment of tools available at the Census Bureau and the
resources provided for the PoC development there are a few key
objectives that will need to be vetted and implemented first to advance
the development of the tool.

The two main objectives that the FISMAtic tool will address are:

  - Development of User Responses

  - Control Selection
