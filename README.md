# FISMAtic :zap:

_Pronounced like "automatic", but starting with "fizz"._

The goal of FISMAtic is to reduce the amount of time spent authoring, reviewing, and editing the security compliance documentation leading up to an Authority to Operate (ATO). We plan to build prototype(s) that:

- Automate validation of and feedback on security compliance documentation
  - Think "Clippy for ATOs" :eyes: :paperclip: :lock:
- Help compliance teams select security controls that are appropriate to a system (tailored baselines)
  - This can cut out time spent around irrelevant controls in all other steps of the compliance lifecycle
