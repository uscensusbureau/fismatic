# FISMAtic :zap:

_Pronounced like "automatic", but starting with "fizz"._

The goal of FISMAtic is to reduce the amount of time spent authoring, reviewing, and editing the security compliance documentation leading up to an Authority to Operate (ATO). We plan to build prototype(s) that:

- Feedback on security compliance documentation
  
- Help compliance teams select security controls that are appropriate to a system (tailored baselines)
  - This can cut out time spent around irrelevant controls in all other steps of the compliance lifecycle
